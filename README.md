Papers and git about the use of AI for nanoscale and scanning probe microscope: 

1. Atomic-Level structural engineering of graphene: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for identification of the atom positions, their element-specific contrast, and the resulting topology: 

https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c01214#

2. The Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) is a set of tools and Python modules for setting up, manipulating, running, visualizing and analyzing atomistic simulations:

3. Machine learning for laser-induced electron diffraction imaging of molecular structures: Combining electron diffraction with machine learning presents new opportunities to image complex and larger molecules in static and time-resolved studies: 

https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-021-00594-z

4. Embedding human heuristics in machine-learning-enabled probe microscopy: The very small number of machine learning approaches to probe microscopy published to date, however, involve classifications based on full images. Given that data acquisition is the most time-consuming task during routine tip conditioning, automated methods are thus currently extremely slow in comparison to the tried-and-trusted strategies and heuristics used routinely by probe microscopists (Philip Moriarty):

5. Automated Searching and Identification of Self-Organized Nanostructures: use a combination of Monte Carlo simulations, general statistics, and machine learning to automatically distinguish several spatially correlated patterns in a mixed, highly varied data set of real AFM images of self-organized nanoparticles:

6. Improving the segmentation of scanning probe microscope images using convolutional neural networks. Segmentation strategy using the U-Net convolutional neural network has some benefits over traditional automated approaches and has particular potential in the processing of images of nanostructured systems:

7. Automation method for the identification of defects prior to atomic fabrication via hydrogen lithography using deep learning. We trained a convolutional neural network to locate and differentiate between surface features of the technologically relevant hydrogen-terminated silicon surface imaged using a scanning tunneling microscope. (Robert Wolkow):

https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07059

9. TOP [REVIEW] Machine learning at the (sub)atomic scale: next generation scanning probe microscopy: We discuss the exciting prospects for a step change in our ability to map and modify matter at the atomic/molecular level by embedding machine learning algorithms in scanning probe microscopy (with a particular focus on scanning tunnelling microscopy, STM). This nano-AI hybrid approach has the far-reaching potential to realise a technology capable of the automated analysis, actuation, and assembly of matter with a precision down to the single chemical bond limit. >>>>>> Are the nanobots nigh? "Extending the Millipede methodology to the atomic level, combined with autonomous control and correction of the apices of the tip array, would enable a dramatic step change in our control of matter with atomic precision":

10. TOP 1 Autonomous robotic nanofabrication with reinforcement learning: Here, we present a strategy to work around both obstacles and demonstrate autonomous robotic nanofabrication by manipulating single molecules. Our approach uses reinforcement learning (RL), which finds solution strategies even in the face of large uncertainty and sparse feedback. We demonstrate the potential of our RL approach by removing molecules autonomously with a scanning probe microscope from a supramolecular structure. Our RL agent reaches an excellent performance, enabling us to automate a task that previously had to be performed by a human.
